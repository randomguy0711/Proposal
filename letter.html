  <h1>To My Dearest Prasunaaaaaaa,<span class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></h1>

  <p>so, i‚Äôve been sitting here, trying to figure out how to put this into words, and honestly, it‚Äôs kind of wild how many feelings are buzzing around in my head when i think about you. like, where do i even start? how do i take all this softness and silliness and love and squish it into sentences?</p>

  <p>maybe i'll just start with this: i really, really love you.  Like, the kind of love that makes my heart feel warm, my stomach do little flips, and puts a big silly smile on my face. and it‚Äôs not just when we‚Äôre talking or hanging out ‚Äî it‚Äôs all the time. you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ there. in my brain. in the best way.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs the little things, you know? the way you say certain words, or the way you laugh at your own jokes, or the weird, adorable things you do without even realizing it. sometimes you‚Äôll just look at me a certain way, and i swear my heart does this little cartwheel and then faceplants, and i‚Äôm like, okay. cool. i'm in trouble.</p>

<p>you make everything feel lighter. brighter. like suddenly the world has better lighting or something. you make boring days interesting. you make ordinary moments feel like little golden ones i want to bottle up and keep in my pocket forever. and when stuff is hard or heavy, somehow just hearing your voice or reading a message from you makes me breathe easier. you‚Äôre like a human exhale. a cozy hoodie. a warm cup of something good.</p>

<p>also, you‚Äôre so weird. and i say that as the highest compliment. like, you‚Äôre this perfect mix of funny and thoughtful and chaotic and soft. you‚Äôll be making the dumbest joke one minute and then saying something that makes me stare at my phone or blink at the ceiling like, ‚Äúdid they just say that? did they just say something that sweet and thoughtful out of nowhere like it‚Äôs no big deal?? rude.‚Äù you make me feel so many things all at once and somehow it‚Äôs never too much. it just feels right.</p>

<p>i love how easy it is to be around you. how i don‚Äôt have to pretend or filter or be some polished version of myself. i can be messy, tired, anxious, ridiculous ‚Äî and you still look at me like i‚Äôm made of stardust. (okay, that sounds a little cheesy, but hey, love makes you soft. i‚Äôm just letting it happen.)</p>

<p>and you? you‚Äôre so much more than i can explain. you‚Äôre kind in ways that sneak up on people. you care deeply, even when you try to act cool or chill. i see it. i see how much heart you put into things, how much you show up for the people you care about, how much love you have packed into that beautiful soul of yours. you don‚Äôt have to say it ‚Äî i feel it. every day.</p>

<p>being with you feels like a long exhale after holding my breath for too long. like, oh. this. this is what it‚Äôs supposed to feel like. safe. happy. soft. a little silly. a little electric. but mostly just‚Ä¶ right.</p>

<p>i think about holding your hand a lot. not just the hand part, but the whole thing ‚Äî walking next to you, shoulder to shoulder, maybe swinging our arms a little like dorks. bumping into each other and laughing. stopping for snacks. talking about everything and nothing. just being close. being yours. being us.</p>

<p>i want a million little moments with you. i want lazy mornings and late-night drives and dumb arguments about which cereal is superior. i want quiet hugs and loud laughter and random tuesday adventures. i want to know what your favorite smell is and what dreams you had when you were five and what you‚Äôd name a pet duck if you had one (and yes, i fully support us getting a pet duck at some point).</p>

<p>i want to be the person you call when something good happens. and when something bad does too. i want to cheer for you, hold space for you, grow with you. i want to be your soft place to land. your safe person. your biggest fan.</p>

<p>you make me want to be better. not in a ‚Äúfix me‚Äù way ‚Äî in a ‚Äúyou make me believe i can do more, be more‚Äù kind of way. you make me want to try. to care. to be brave. because loving you is the easiest, bravest thing i‚Äôve ever done.</p>

<p>sometimes i catch myself smiling like a total idiot just thinking about you. like, full-on cheeks-hurting, heart-wiggly, butterflies-in-the-ribcage kind of smile. and i don‚Äôt even try to stop it. why would i? this feeling is rare. and beautiful. and i want to soak up every second of it.</p>

<p>i love the idea of building something with you. not just romantic stuff, but a whole life. memories. jokes only we get. playlists and photos and late-night confessions. tiny traditions that are ours alone. a whole story that starts with right now and goes on and on.</p>

<p>i don‚Äôt know what the future holds, but i know i want you in it. i want all the versions of you ‚Äî the sleepy one, the excited one, the anxious one, the one that dances around the kitchen or rants about random stuff or gets really quiet sometimes. i want all of you. every part.</p>

<p>so yeah. this is me, just sitting here, thinking about how much i adore you. how much you mean to me. how lucky i feel to even know you, let alone love you.</p>



  <p>you‚Äôre magic. pure, ridiculous, lovable magic. and i‚Äôm so glad i get to be part of your world.</p>
