  <h1>To My Dearest Prasunaaaaaaa,<span class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></h1>

  <p>So, I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how to put this into words and honestly I have a lot of feelings roaming around my head when I think of my cutie. Like, where do I even start. How do I even explain what I am feeling right now. How do I take all this softness and silliness and love and put it into sentences?</p>

<p>Maybe I will start like this. I am so deeply in love with you. So deep that my heart feels warm, butterflies on my stomach and puts a big silly smile on my face. You are just glued to my heart, my mind. You are like blood flowing in my every vein and every artery that lastly reaches this heart which is pumping the blood just enough to make me survive.</p>

<p>I notice every little thing you do. The way you start chanting how your day was or the way you laugh at your own jokes and how adorable I find you when you start smiling out of nowhere. And suddenly you are the most beautiful girl on this planet. The way you look at me with those big eyes angrily, my heart skips a beat and then crashes down. Your scolds sound like a beautiful poem.</p>

<p>You make everything feel lighter. Brighter. Like suddenly the world becomes a better place to live. You make boring days interesting. You make ordinary moments feel like little golden ones I want to pack up and keep in my pocket forever. And when everything feels heavy, somehow just hearing your voice or reading a message from you makes me breathe easier. You are warm and the most comfiest thing so I want us both in a cozy hoodie with our skin touching each other.</p>

<p>Do you know what the most unique thing about you is? You are weird! Yes, because you are funny and thoughtful and understanding and soft and beautiful and caring and and and it can go all the way to infinity. And you are the bestest thing that has happened to me ever. My Prasuna, I am so in love with you...</p>

<p>I love how easy it is to be around you. How I don‚Äôt have to pretend or filter or be some polished version of myself. I can be messy, tired, anxious, ridiculous, weak and you look at me like I am the most amazing person in this world. You make me feel like love is soft so I am just letting it happen to me.</p>

<p>And you? You are beyond my explaining. If I start talking about your appearance, you look like an angel (swarga bata jhareki apsara) to me. Your eyes are beautiful, your eyelashes are more beautiful and your lips, your cheeks, your teeth, your skin, your hands, your hair, your softness ‚Äî how do I explain that? You are just a perfect human God can ever make. And if that is not enough, you are kind (at least to me). You have a heart of gold. I see how much effort you put into things, how much you show up for the people you care about, how much love you have packed into that beautiful soul of yours. You don‚Äôt have to say it ‚Äî I feel it. Every day, every second.</p>

<p>Our destiny has just let us meet once but those few hours you gave me were the bestest time in all my 20 years of existence. And you know what? After that day I think about holding your hands a lot. Not just the hand part, but the whole part where I walk next to you under the same umbrella, shoulder to shoulder, me glancing at your face every two seconds. Stopping somewhere for snacks and talking about everything and nothing. Just being so close to you. Being us.</p>

<p>I want a million little moments with you. I want to see your messy face in the morning, where you wake up in my arms and I can stare at that face a little longer. I want to decide and argue about what we‚Äôre having for breakfast and lunch. I want soft hugs and loud laughter and random Tuesday trips. I want to know everything you have left to share with me, like what was your dream when you were five and if you like any pet?</p>

<p>I want to be the person you call when something good happens ‚Äî and something bad too. I want to be the first to cheer for you. I want to grow with you. I want to live with you. I want to be your safe place to land, your safe person and your biggest fan. You make me want to be a better person. Not in a way to fix me, but you make me believe I can do more and make me want to try. To care, to be brave ‚Äî because loving you is the easiest thing I have ever done.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find myself smiling like a total idiot just thinking about you ‚Äî like the smile that hurts my cheeks and makes my heart feel free. I can't even stop smiling remembering how we got up to this point. How a person who feels scared to talk to girls is now flirting continuously 24/7 with his only beloved sweetheart. Wow, what a beautiful journey it was. I hope this brings a little smile on your face as well.</p>

<p>I want to build something with you. Not just love but our life. I want to build a house with you and our family. I want to have kids with you. I want to click pictures with you and I want to confess my feelings to you every day. I want to dance with you in the kitchen. I want to go on late-night walks with you. I want to start my journey with you. I don't know where our future is taking us by making us 7679 miles apart from each other but I want you when I look at my future. I want you there at any cost.</p>

<p>So yeah. This is me just sitting here when you are talking with your pyari Resma on that video call, missing you, thinking how much I adore you. How much you mean to me. And how I suddenly became the luckiest person on this planet to know you and got to love you all alone. I am glad to be part of your beautiful world.</p>
